# Tests
- Tests have been implemented in xunit.

## Steps to run
- Start the service before running the tests. The steps for it can be found in appropriate folder.
- Use the command `dotnet test` to execute tests.

## Possible improvements
- Tests are currently not comprehensive enough. More test cases should be added. In most of the cases, only positive test case is present (except tests related to adding and removing words to word list).
